## Blackjack Package

This is a package that allows a single user to continuously play
blackjack hands from a blackjack shoe with an even number of decks.
The default setting of the package is a six deck shoe.
The package uses the input function to allow for the user to play
every hand, in which the user can hit, stand, double, or split.
Play ends either when the user decides to stop playing or when the shoe ends.
Data from the shoe is then exported as a dataframe to a csv file.
If the user wants to continue playing, a new shoe will be dealt.
